      <p>
        Welcome to my profile! I am currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp at
        Sydney University Online, pursuing a career change and acquiring new
        skills. My goal is to become more productive and make the most of my
        time compared to my previous experiences. Through this program, I can
        enjoy a structured learning environment and enhance my coding abilities.
      </p>

        Since December 2022, I have been self-teaching myself how to code.
        However, I decided to join this course to further refine my knowledge
        and skills in a more organized manner.

        During my free time, when I manage to find some, I love to go camping
        with my brothers. Nature fascinates me, and I often embark on refreshing
        bush walks, appreciating the beauty of the outdoors.
